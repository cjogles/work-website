## My experience

I progressed through a 4 unit curriculum at lambda school to become competent web developer for the workforce. I began with the basics i.e. html, css, javascript and then I studied the front end framework of React and back end framework of Node.js. The last unit I covered computer science fundamentals such as algorithims, data structures and their applications. After finishing the curriculum I opted to stay a few months longer to be a team lead for another cohort of students to teach them what I had just learned. This was a paid position and I credit this position and its duties to teaching me the skills necessary to succeed at work more then anything because I learned how to talk about and apply what I had learned in a very concrete way. It was a great program when I had the opportunity to go, and I loved the fact that I didn't have to pay tutition until I got a job paying 50k/yr or more. That helped lessen the financial burden considerably.
