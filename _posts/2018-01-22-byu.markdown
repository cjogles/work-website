## My experience

I was born into a family who devoutly follows the edicts of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They have great faith in their christian values. I adopted these beliefs and notions and so went to the church owned university of BYU. I had a great experience here! The professors were upstanding and the curriculum was fantastic. My interests were wide and my questions deep, and BYU gave me the chance to explore these things while I studied psychology and got my bachelors degree of science. I no longer subscribe to the notions and beliefs of the church of my families origin, but I certainly love my family and these church going people all the same. Glad I went here and learned what I did.
