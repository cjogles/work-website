## My experience

After college I had the opportunity to work with the state in child protective services in southern Utah. This was a mind blowing experience. At first all I did was take notes and document things that were going on that other state employees did. Eventually however, my internship portion of the job ended and I was tasked to do the job myself. I was given a state vehicle to drive out to different locations to teach families about steps they could take to live safer and more abundant lives. I held interviews with parents and children to assess what was going on in the home to prepare meaningful action plans for those famileis. I learned forensic child interviewing techniques to interview children who had been through tragic abuse, and I collaborated with law enforcement and other state employees in the court on a regular basis. I did this all when I was newly married and didn't have any children of my own. It made me think once or twice about what it would be like to have children of my own let me tell you! 

After doing this job for a year or two, I decided that I wanted a more flexible job with a little less stress on my humanity. So I opted to study web development to become a software engineer.
