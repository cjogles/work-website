My first working experience. Worked for the state Utah to serve families and children undergoing difficult situations.

## My experience

Working for DCFS put me face to face with southern Utah's families and individuals to enable and assist them to meet their family safety and wellness goals. I spent time in court assisting families in their understanding of court mandated actions and procedures, facilitated child forensic interviews, and wrote documentation on all work proceedings throughout my internship and job at DCFS. I enjoyed good professional relationships with my co-workers and enjoyed my time here. 

After I got married however, I decided to switch to software engineering to achieve more flexibility and work-life balance. So I started my software engineering education soon after leaving this occupation.

## Skills picked up

- Collaboration
- Presentation 
- Deescalation
- Assessment
- Just learned a lot about what is out there in the world. Humbled me immensely.
