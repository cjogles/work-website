## My team

I worked remotely for Nu Skin as a software engineer. My team consists of a scrum leader, product owner, three developers, one quality engineer, one site reliability engineer, one user interface designer, and one content contribution expert. Nu Skin enterprise has a multitude of other teams in the technology department responsible for different things to assist Nu Skin in their digital goals. My team was responsible for product data and representation, primarily on the product detail pages i.e. catalog. We met daily and worked in an agile manner. I enjoyed professional relationships with all of them. 

## My job

My job consisted of a variety of tasks and responsibilities. I assisted in front end work in the Vue framework using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I implemented API functionality using graphql, aws, and REST APIs. I worked with a content management system called Contentstack as well as an aged out CMS called Adobe Experience Manager. I got tickets/tasks from multiple stakeholders and managers from different teams and areas within the company. Sometimes SEO managers wanted me to add an HREFLANG attribute to all the templated pages from AEM, or sometimes google analytics wanted me to asssit in tagging different elements in the DOM for measuring clicks in services like Fullstory. Other times I was asked to write react native code to introduce dark mode to their mobile app. The tasks change from day to day, and the variety is fun. The pace is reasonable and there is time to upskill significantly at the end of each sprint. I loveed my time here.
