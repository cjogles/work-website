## My team

I work remotely for Nu Skin as a software engineer. My team consists of a scrum leader, product owner, three developers, one quality engineer, one site reliability engineer, one user interface designer, and one content contribution expert. The Nu Skin enterprise has a multitude of other teams in the technology department responsible for different things to assist Nu Skin in their digital age goals. My team is responsible for product data and representation, primarily on the product detail pages. We meet daily and work in an agile manner. I enjoy professional relationships with all of them. 

## My job

My job consists of a variety of tasks and responsibilities. I assist in front end work in the Vue framework using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I implement API functionality using graphql, aws, and REST APIs. I work with a content management system called Contentstack as well as an aging out CMS called Adobe Experience Manager. I get tickets/tasks from multiple stakeholders and managers from different teams and areas within the company. Sometimes SEO managers want me to add an HREFLANG attribute to all the templated pages from AEM, or sometimes google analytics wants me to asssit in tagging different elements in the DOM for measuring clicks in services like Fullstory. The tasks change from day to day, and the variety is fun. The pace is reasonable and there is time to upskill significantly at the end of each sprint. I love my time here and plan to stay for a long time if I can help it.
