          My name is Jackson Ogles. I'm a driven software engineer who's passionate about staying up to date on latest web technologies. I live north of Salt Lake City, Utah and I enjoy spending time with my family, improving my fitness, and experiencing all that life has to offer when I'm not engaged in my work. Thanks for visiting my site. Looking forward to our work together. ðŸ˜Š
