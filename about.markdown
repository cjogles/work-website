# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

<div style="display: flex;">
     <p>
          My name is Jackson Ogles. I'm a driven web developer who's passionate about staying up to date on latest technologies and all things software engineering. I live north of Salt Lake City, Utah. I enjoy spending time with my family when I'm not digging into fun computer science projects. Thanks for visiting my site. I hope we can collaborate in the work force soon. ðŸ˜Š
